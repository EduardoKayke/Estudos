## Comandos para iniciar o React

- Start Project.
    ```react
    npx create-react-app nomeProjeto
    ```

- Inside that directory, you can run several commands:
    - Starts the development server.
        ```react
        npm start
        ```
    - Bundles the app into static files for production.
        ```react
        npm run build
        ```
    - Starts the test runner.
        ```react
        npm test
        ```
    - Removes this tool and copies build dependencies,configuration and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
        ```react
        npm run eject
        ```
        
- We suggest that you begin by typing:
    ```react
    cd PastaProjeto
    npm start
    ```
